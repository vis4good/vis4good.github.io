<h3 id="why-a-vis-for-social-good-panel">Why a <em>Vis for Social Good</em> Panel?</h3>

<p><strong>What role (if any) should data visualization play in effecting positive change in the world?</strong></p>

<p>There is a growing “techlash” that highlights the potential of data science (and data visualization) as tools for reinforcing structures of inequality and injustice.</p>

<p>We envision this panel to function as a way of airing these competing viewpoints and providing guidance on how the visualization community should use their power and responsibilities in the world.</p>

    Evan Peck is an Associate Professor of Computer Science at Bucknell University. Evan's research sits at the intersection of HCI and Visualization, broadly exploring how technology can empower diverse groups of people to understand their world through data. Recently, his visualization work interviewing community members in rural Pennsylvania was the recipient of a 2019 CHI Best Paper Award. Evan also acts as an advocate for ethical approaches in core engineering curriculum. His curricular development pairs issues of bias, fairness, and social impact directly with technical content (\url{https://ethicalcs.github.io/}), and has been adopted by universities across the country. Finally, Evan serves as a member of ACM SIGCHI's Research Ethics Committee. He earned his Ph.D. in 2014 in Computer Science from Tufts University.
