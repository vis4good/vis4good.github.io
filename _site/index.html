<h3 id="welcome">Welcome</h3>

<p>We are proud to announce the first <strong>Workshop on Visualization for Social Good</strong> to be held as part of <a href="http://ieeevis.org/year/2021/welcome">IEEE VIS 2021</a>. The goal of this workshop is to:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong><em>provide a central venue within the IEEE VIS community for surfacing work that critiques, defines, or explores the impact of data visualization on society.</em></strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Visualization, like all fields connected with how we collect, interpret, and communicate data, has an immense potential impact on society, for good or for ill. It is up to us to make sure our work affects positive change in the world. The Visualization for Social Good Workshop (Vis4Good) aims to provide a central venue within the IEEE VIS community for surfacing work that critiques, defines, or explores the impact of data visualization on society. Through a blend of paper sessions, invited presentations, and break-out groups, we hope that the inaugural Vis4Good 2021 Workshop encourages attendees to harness visualization research to tackle critical challenges in responsible AI, clean energy, human health and well-being, and other domain areas with critical societal impact.</p>

<h3 id="new-call-for-lightning-talks">(New!) Call for Lightning Talks</h3>

<p>To include diverse perspectives beyond our accepted research papers on this topic, we are introducing lightning talks: a low-barrier way to present research/design studies (even if they have been presented at other venues!), provocations/critiques, or organizations that contribute to the mission of our workshop.</p>

<p>We expect that each lightning talk will consist of roughly 3 minutes of speaking time during the workshop (time may vary depending on submissions) and a single slide. All talks and presenters will be advertised on the website as well as in our social media promotional material.</p>

<p>Submissions should be made at: <a href="https://bit.ly/vis4good-lightning">https://bit.ly/vis4good-lightning</a></p>

<h3 id="call-for-papers">Call for Papers</h3>
<p>We as designers, researchers, and technologists, have many opportunities ahead of us, as laid out in aspirational plans like the <a href="https://sdgs.un.org/goals">UN Sustainable Development Goals</a>, the NAE <a href="http://www.engineeringchallenges.org/challenges.aspx">Grand Challenges for Engineering</a>, and the NSF <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/news/special_reports/big_ideas/">10 Big Ideas</a>. Yet, as the “techlash” continues, we are also seeing how technology has the power to magnify inequality, injustice, or other societal ills.</p>

<p>With the power that comes with collecting, interpreting, and communicating data in visualization, there is naturally a social <em>responsibility.</em> To do good and avoid harm, we should make our values as a field explicit, criticize and critique the work we do that has a potential for harm, develop a pedagogy around the socially responsible design and use of visualization, and develop good patterns for fruitful collaboration with stakeholders working on key societal problems.</p>

<p>To that end, we are soliciting work that deals with the social impact of visualization work. Potential contributions might include (but are not limited to):</p>

<ul>
  <li>Design studies, “collaboration journals,” or other best practices for visualization work in domains with high social impact. Examples include:
    <ul>
      <li>Public health, development, and sustainable growth</li>
      <li>Inclusivity, accessibility, and disability rights</li>
      <li>Diversity, racial equality, and gender equality</li>
      <li>Sustainability, ecology, and environmental activism</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Explorations of design considerations for visualizations for mass audiences or policymakers. Examples include:
    <ul>
      <li>Building statistical or visualization literacy and fluency</li>
      <li>Persuasion, misinformation, and deception</li>
      <li>Accessibility</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Critiques, manifestos, or provocations around social or ethical responsibilities in visualization design or research</li>
</ul>

<p>Consult our <a href="resources">resources page</a> for sample works.</p>

<p>Papers will be <em>up to four pages, plus up to one page of references</em>, in <a href="https://tc.computer.org/vgtc/publications/conference/">VGTC two-column format</a>. Authors may elect to have their paper included archivally, or, per the authors’ request (e.g., for in-progress work), to have the work be presented but excluded from formal conference proceedings.</p>

<p>Submissions will be made via <a href="https://new.precisionconference.com/submissions">PCS</a> and single-blind reviewed by the program committee.</p>

<p><strong>Applying Racial Equity Awareness in Data Visualization</strong>
How can analysts, researchers, and developers apply a race- and ethnicity-conscious lens to their data analysis and data visualization work? How can we take a more diverse, equitable, and inclusive (DEI) perspective to our research, data, and visualizations? Just as we carefully consider our written words, we should be equally careful in how we visually present data to our readers, users, and audiences, including the words we use in and around those visuals. Taking a DEI perspective means considering how the specific lived experiences and perspectives of the people and communities we are studying, as well as our readers, will perceive information and carry that information forward. In this talk, we discuss a variety of techniques that data visualization producers should consider when creating visuals with this DEI approach.</p>

<p>Dr. Jonathan Schwabish is an economist, writer, teacher, and creator of policy-relevant data visualizations. He is considered a leading voice for clarity and accessibility in how researchers communicate their findings. His book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0231175205/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0231175205&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=poli03-20&amp;linkId=7G4NKCTMS2VE2GXI">Better Presentations: A Guide for Scholars, Researchers, and Wonks</a> helps people improve the way they prepare, design, and deliver data-rich content and his edited book, <a href="https://amzn.to/2rrVbXS">Elevated the Debate: A Multilayered Approach to Communicating Your Research</a>, helps people develop a strategic plan to communicating their work across multiple platforms and channels. His latest book, <a href="https://amzn.to/2zHQ4qv">Better Data Visualizations: A Guide for Scholars, Researchers, and Wonks</a> details essential strategies to create more effective data visualizations. He is on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/jschwabish">@jschwabish</a>.</p>
