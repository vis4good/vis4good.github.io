<h3 id="welcome">Welcome</h3>

<p>We are proud to announce the third <strong>Workshop on Visualization for Social Good</strong> to be held as part of <a href="https://ieeevis.org/year/2023/welcome">IEEE VIS 2023</a>. The goal of this workshop is to:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong><em>provide a central venue within the IEEE VIS community for surfacing work that critiques, defines, or explores the impact of data visualization on society in order to build just and equitable futures.</em></strong></li>
</ul>

<p> Data is an inescapable part of our lives: it guides commerce, government, and technology, and increasingly determines what lives we can (or cannot) live. Data visualization has a special place within this emerging, data-driven, order: as a tool to inform or persuade mass audiences, guide or enlighten the specialist, or give a voice to the unheard. We therefore pose the question: how can visualization, and visualization research, help us build the worlds we want? This theme, building just and equitable futures, is the motivation behind our proposal for a third edition of our recurring workshop at IEEE VIS: Visualization for Social Good. Our workshop series has had success not only at showcasing high-quality socially-minded visualization research from diverse voices, but also in starting important conversations around the role of data visualization as a force for good in society at large. We hope to continue this effort in 2023. Additionally, as our workshop matures, we feel our choice of theme allows us to take a more longitudinal focus as both a workshop and as a community. Our workshop, if accepted, would also occur amid a larger conversation about the role of data in human dignity and flourishing. </p>

<h3 id="call-for-papers">Call for Papers</h3>

<p>We as designers, researchers, and technologists, have many opportunities ahead of us, as laid out in aspirational plans like the <a href="https://sdgs.un.org/goals">UN Sustainable Development Goals</a>, the NAE <a href="http://www.engineeringchallenges.org/challenges.aspx">Grand Challenges for Engineering</a>, and the NSF <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/news/special_reports/big_ideas/">10 Big Ideas</a>. Yet, as the “techlash” continues, we are also seeing how technology has the power to magnify inequality, injustice, or other societal ills.</p>

<p>With the power that comes with collecting, interpreting, and communicating data in visualization, there is naturally a social <em>responsibility.</em> To do good and avoid harm, we should make our values as a field explicit, criticize and critique the work we do that has a potential for harm, develop a pedagogy around the socially responsible design and use of visualization, and develop good patterns for fruitful collaboration with stakeholders working on key societal problems.</p>

<p>To that end, we are soliciting work that deals with the social impact of visualization work. 
In order to focus the goals of our workshop, provide inspiration to potential attendees or submitters, and to reflect on the pressing issues of contemporary importance, we propose the following theme for the 2022 workshop: <strong>pedagogy</strong>, <strong>process</strong>, and <strong>protest</strong>.</p>

<ul>
  <li>We have the potential to re-imagine visualization <strong>pedagogy</strong>: to build curricula that encourage closer connections with communities and public service, build up data literacy in crucial audiences, or to better integrate ethical practices and thinking in how we conceptualize visualization as a discipline.</li>
  <li>The <strong>process</strong> of designing, evaluating, or circulating visualizations takes on a special character and urgency when dealing with matters of social importance, or as part of collaborations and relationships between visualizations experts and mass audiences.</li>
  <li>Visualization can also act as a powerful tool for advocacy and <strong>protest</strong>: charts and graphs can place inequality or inequity in stark relief, and can act as a persuasive in a world that strives to be “data-driven.”’ However, visualization designers themselves, through resistance or refusal, can comment on the unequal ways that data are collected, presented, or organized in our society.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="contributions">Contributions</h4>
<p>Potential contributions might include (but are not limited to):</p>

<ul>
  <li>Design studies, “collaboration journals,” or other best practices for visualization work in domains with high social impact. Examples include:</li>
  <li>Public health, development, and sustainable growth</li>
  <li>Inclusivity, accessibility, and disability rights</li>
  <li>Diversity, racial equality, and gender equality</li>
  <li>Sustainability, ecology, and environmental activism</li>
  <li>Explorations of design considerations for visualizations for mass audiences or policymakers. Examples include:</li>
  <li>Building statistical or visualization literacy and fluency</li>
  <li>Persuasion, misinformation, and deception</li>
  <li>Accessibility</li>
  <li>Critiques, manifestos, or provocations around social or ethical responsibilities in visualization design or research</li>
</ul>

<p>Consult our <a href="resources">resources page</a>, <a href="workshop2021">2021</a> and <a href="workshop2022">2022 workshops</a> for sample works.</p>

<h4 id="submissions">Submissions</h4>

<p>Papers will be <em>up to four pages, plus up to one page of references</em>, in <a href="https://tc.computer.org/vgtc/publications/conference/">VGTC two-column format</a>. Authors may elect to have their paper included archivally, or, per the authors’ request (e.g., for in-progress work), to have the work be presented but excluded from formal conference proceedings. The deadline for paper submissions is <em>July 20</em>.</p>

<p>Authors also have the option to submit a <em>2-page abstract for a poster</em> to be presented at the workshop. Poster abstracts follow the same format as paper submissions and will not be archived. The deadline for poster submissions is <em>September 7</em>.</p>

<p>Paper and poster submissions will be made via <a href="https://new.precisionconference.com/submissions">PCS</a> and single-blind reviewed by the program committee.</p>

<p><strong>Time, Space and Place: How to Break All Of Data’s Rules</strong></p>

<p>In this presentation, Jer Thorp will share a decade’s worth of work that seeks to break down the rules we have built for data representation, and the rigid demands we’ve put on our audiences. Starting with static visualization and stretching to sculpture, performance and participatory art, Thorp will examine how refusing to comply with Tuftian standards might give data a chance to speak to wider audiences about complex topics.</p>
