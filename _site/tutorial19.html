<h3 id="why-a-vis-for-social-good-tutorial">Why a <em>Vis for Social Good</em> Tutorial?</h3>
<p>We believe that visualization researchers, teachers, and practitioners can and <em>should</em> use the explanatory and persuasive power of visualizations to promote social good in their communities and the wider world.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the skills required to make these impacts are often excluded from standard visualization curricula, requiring considerations of presenting data to diverse audiences, working with uncertain data sources, and examining the ethical impacts of data collection and analysis.</p>

<h3 id="what-is-the-vis-for-social-good-tutorial">What is the <em>Vis for Social Good</em> Tutorial?</h3>
<p>Hosted by <a href="http://ieeevis.org">IEEE VIS 2019</a>, this half-day tutorial will collaboratively address the visualization challenges of social issues that attendees feel passionately about. Organizers will provide lightning-talks on visualizationâ€™s social impact, ethics, and evaluation. Together, attendees and organizers will work with their complementary skillsets to contribute to social issue through a novel visualization, a novel dataset, or a new perspective on an existing problem.</p>
