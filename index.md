### Welcome

We are proud to announce the second **Workshop on Visualization for Social Good** to be held as part of [IEEE VIS 2022](http://ieeevis.org/year/2022/welcome). The goal of this workshop is to:
- ***provide a central venue within the IEEE VIS community for surfacing work that critiques, defines, or explores the impact of data visualization on society.***

There are many ways that work in visualization can have immediate social impact--- working closely with community stakeholders, exploring how to present data for mass audiences, evaluating the potential of visualization for advocacy or as a tool to shape public policy--- all have the potential to reshape society for the better. Thoughtfulness, reflection, and critique are likewise important to build up a clear picture of both the potential benefits and potential harms of visualization research.

In order to focus the goals of our workshop, provide inspiration to potential attendees or submitters, and to reflect on the pressing issues of contemporary importance, we propose the following theme for the 2022 workshop: pedagogy, process, and protest.


* We have the potential to re-imagine visualization *pedagogy*: to build curricula that encourage closer connections with communities and public service, build up data literacy in crucial audiences, or to better integrate ethical practices and thinking in how we conceptualize visualization as a discipline.
* The *process* of designing, evaluating, or circulating visualizations takes on a special character and urgency when dealing with matters of social importance, or as part of collaborations and relationships between visualizations experts and mass audiences.
* Visualization can also act as a powerful tool for advocacy and *protest*: charts and graphs can place inequality or inequity in stark relief, and can act as a persuasive in a world that strives to be "data-driven." However, visualization designers themselves, through resistance or refusal, can comment on the unequal ways that data are collected, presented, or organized in our society.

The Visualization for Social Good Workshop (Vis4Good) aims to provide a central venue within the IEEE VIS community for surfacing work that critiques, defines, or explores the impact of data visualization on society. Through a blend of paper sessions, invited presentations, and break-out groups, we hope that the inaugural Vis4Good 2022 Workshop encourages attendees to harness visualization research to tackle critical challenges in responsible AI, clean energy, human health and well-being, and other domain areas with critical societal impact.
